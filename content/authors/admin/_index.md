Hi, I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [hydroclimate research group](https://www.shuoswang.com/) at Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I obtained my PhD in hydrology and climate sciences at PolyU in 2022. Before joining the HK PolyU, I focused on urban expansion and the related environmental impacts and received my M.S. degree from Wuhan University, China in 2018. 

My research interests include extreme weather and climate events, climate change, multivariate statistics (copula and pair-copula construction), and hydrologic simulation. I use multivariate probabilistic approaches to evaluate the characteristics, hazards, and risks of hydroclimate extremes in response to climate change. I also employ climate simulations and hydrologic models to project future changes in concurrent or consecutive water-related hazards in a warming climate.
